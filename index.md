Hello! I am a Junior at the Harker School with an interest in Artificial Intelligence and its practical applications for creating impact in people's lives, especially through the lens of machine learning and computer vision.

Currently, I'm working on a project with the goal of making a currently available remote photoplethysmography model more robust for compressed datasets by incorporating video restoration.

In this blog, I'll be sharing insights from my ongoing projects, discussing developments within the field of AI, and the amazing potential AI has for improving society. Join me as I uncover new ways technology can transform the world!
